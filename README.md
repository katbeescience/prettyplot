# prettyplot
This makes a pretty plot! Anyone should be able to use this script, regardless of OS (hopefully!). If you're new to R, it's still easy. Just follow these instructions.

The first two steps are for the first time only:

1) Download R from this trusted link: https://www.r-project.org/

2) Download the R file prettyplot.R from this link: https://github.com/katbeescience/prettyplot

3) Save this file on your Desktop.

Here's what you would do every time after this:

1) Open R.
2) In the R console that opens up, copy/paste this:

source("~\Desktop\prettyplot.R")

3) Just follow the prompt from there! Enjoy :)
